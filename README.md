# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

### Watch Live Demo : https://parvbhatia.github.io/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer/<br /><br />

A web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms.

 **Implemented Alogorithms :**
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort
<br />

**Features :**
1. Colour representation of steps being executed : 

        1.1 Blue : Default 
	
        1.2 Yellow : Being Compared 
	
        1.3 Red : Identified as incorrect position and to be moved 
	
        1.4 Green : In Correct Position
        
2. Three controls for visualizations : 

        2.1 Speed of Visualization (5 speed levels) 
	
        2.2 Data size 
	
        2.3 Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data) 
	
        
3. Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.
